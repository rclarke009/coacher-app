🕊 Morning Flow Adjustment
Current:
After the user finishes Morning Focus, the app instantly resets the “Morning Focus Area” back to Breathing (as if ready for tomorrow).
Issue:
That makes it feel like the user’s effort just disappeared — no reward moment, no closure, and the UI is ahead of real time.
Better Flow:
✅ Completion Screen:
Big checkmark animation (Calm Style, like your Part B mini-celebrations).
Text: “Morning Focus complete. You’re ready to win the day.”
Optional haptic “success” pulse.
🌿 Encouragement line:
Rotate through phrases like “Carry this focus with you today.” or “One mindful morning at a time.”
🕐 Reset timing:
Keep their chosen focus visible all day (so it reinforces identity).
Reset to “Breathing” at midnight or when they start their evening check-in, whichever comes first.
This preserves continuity (“I’m still in today’s focus”) and simplifies day-phase logic in currentPhase().
🌙 End-of-Day Check-In Intro
Goal: Make the start of evening feel friendly and sequential, not visually overwhelming.
Recommended structure:
Step 1 — Warm entry card:
“Give yourself a pat on the back — you’re showing up to make a better tomorrow.”
Button: “I’m here.”
→ When tapped:
Show a smiling mini-animation or gentle sparkle.
Fade in text:
“You showed up today. That matters.” 😊
Then show Next → to continue to “Did you do your care action?” screen.
This matches the celebration layering pattern from Part B: short emotional hit first, then transition into reflection.
