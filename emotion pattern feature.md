📘 Weight Loss Coach – Emotional Take Over Flow Addendum
Overview
This addition enhances the “I Need Help” feature by providing a structured mini-coach sequence for users experiencing an emotionally triggered food urge.
It integrates with the 'i need help' 'emotional' category.  We can add the button for 'When Emotions Start to Take Over'  at the top of the list of advice.
