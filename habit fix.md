📘 Weight Loss Coach – Habit Fix
Overview
This addition enhances the “I Need Help” feature by providing a structured mini-coach sequence for users experiencing an habit triggered food urge.
It integrates with the 'i need help' 'habit' category.  We can add the button for 'Habit Helper'  at the top of the list of advice.
Step 1 – Identify the pattern
Prompt (text field or voice):
“What were you doing just before the craving hit?”
(Example shown: ‘Just finished work.’)
Step 2 – Learn
Short card copy:
“Your brain links cues, routines, and rewards.
This urge might be an automatic loop — not real hunger or emotion.”
Cue → Routine → Reward
Step 3 – Try an experiment
Quick options (buttons):
⏸ Pause 30 seconds
🚶 Stretch / step outside
💧 Drink water
🎵 Play one song
Caption:
“See if the craving fades. Awareness weakens the loop.”
Step 4 – Rewire
Tiny journaling line:
“Next time this cue shows up, what would feel rewarding instead of food?”
Step 5 – Encourage
